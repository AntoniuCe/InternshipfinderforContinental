# InternshipfinderforContinental
 I created a script to search for an internship in Timisoara inside Continental
 You will need the requests library, json library and the openpyxl library
 I created this script if someone needs to find a job as a student inside continental, this script shows you every info that is displayed on the site inside an excel saved inside the file
