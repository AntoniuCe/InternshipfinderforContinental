# InternshipfinderforContinental
 I created a script to search for an internship in Timisoara inside Continental
 You will need the requests library and the json library
 I created this script if someone needs to find a job as a student inside continental, this script shows you the name of the internship, the date it was published and it gives you the site to check it out
